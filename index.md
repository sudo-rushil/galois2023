## Galois 2023 – Covering Theory in Algebra and Geometry

<b>Overview:</b>

This is an IAP 2023 topics course in the theory of Galois correspondences, a framework for studying number theory, algebraic topology, complex analysis, and algebraic geometry.

<!-- <span style="color:blue">We're currently organizing everything! Click [<u>here</u>](interest.html) to RSVP for more information!</span> -->

We will first discuss the classical theory of (infinite) Galois extensions. Then, we will explore how the main theorem of Galois theory has an analog in the theory of covering spaces and fundamental groups. Finally, we will introduce some algebraic geometry to formulate modern versions of these correspondences via *étale fundamental groups*.


<b>Schedule:</b>

- Dates: Jan 9th – Jan 26th
- Meeting Times: M-Th 4:30-6:00 PM
- Location: 4-153
- Office Hours: TBD

<b>Prerequisites:</b>

18.702 and 18.901, or equivalent. We will review Galois theory and topological covering spaces, but familiarity will be helpful. No prior experience with scheme theory is necessary.

<b>Notes and Exericses:</b>

Roughly, we will follow parts of Szamuely's [Galois Groups and Fundamental Groups](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511627064), but with a more algebraic focus. See [<u>Resources</u>](resources.html) for lecture notes, additional references, and (optional!) problem sets.

<!-- We will meet once a week on Zoom from early June to mid August. Each meeting will consist of a talk given by one of the participants, followed by a question/discussion session.  -->
