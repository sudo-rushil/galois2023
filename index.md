## Galois 2023 – Covering Theory in Algebra and Geometry

<b>Overview:</b>

This is an IAP 2023 topics course in the theory of Galois correspondences, a framework for studying number theory, algebraic topology, complex analysis, and algebraic geometry.

<span style="color:blue">The course is over, but contact us if you have any questions!</span>

<!-- <span style="color:blue">We're currently organizing everything! Click [<u>here</u>](interest.html) to RSVP for more information!</span> -->

We will first discuss the classical theory of (infinite) Galois extensions. Then, we will explore how the main theorem of Galois theory has an analog in the theory of covering spaces and fundamental groups. Finally, we will introduce some algebraic geometry to formulate modern versions of these correspondences via *étale fundamental groups*.

Roughly, we followed Szamuely's [Galois Groups and Fundamental Groups](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511627064), but with an algebraic focus. <!-- See [<u>Resources</u>](resources.html) for lecture notes, additional references, and (optional!) problem sets. -->
